# Ensemble-learning
It's typically used when you use multiple learning algorithms and put it together to form a bigger, better algorithm. A good example of this which I'm practicing here is Randomized Decision Forests. A forest is an ensemble of trees and each tree consists of split nodes and leaf nodes. Pretty obvious.
